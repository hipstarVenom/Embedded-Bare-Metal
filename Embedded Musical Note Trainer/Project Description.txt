This project is an embedded system designed to demonstrate the generation of musical notes with synchronized visual feedback. A 74HC595 serial-in parallel-out shift register is used to control multiple LEDs, each representing a musical note (Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa). When a button is pressed, the corresponding LED lights up through the shift register, while a buzzer generates the associated frequency using timer-based square wave output. The system is implemented in bare-metal AVR C on the ATmega328P microcontroller, without relying on Arduino libraries, providing low-level control of GPIO, timers, and SPI communication. This integration of hardware and software creates an interactive platform for learning basic musical notes with both audio and visual cues.
